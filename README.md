Scripts used in "Identification of a sex-determining locus potentially involved in a conflict over sex-ratio" (submitted)

Baptiste Lh√©raud, Yann Dussert, Mohamed Amine Chebbi, Isabelle Giraud, Richard Cordaux, Jean Peccoud

The scripts are not a ready-to-use piece of software to investigate sex chromosomes in other species. They are provided to document our method. Not every step of the pipeline was scripted.

Scripts starting with numbers were run (from an R console) in that ordrer. The other provided scripts were sourced from the numbered scripts.
